If you already have a Kiosk set up in your Octoblu account, then you can use it by going to “Things” and then to “Connected Things”.

#### Note:
* In order for the Kiosk to work with your Octoblu flow, make sure to keep it open in a separate tab. Once you run the flow, your custom message or URL will be opened in the Kiosk tab.
* Some websites like Google, Facebook will not be opened using Kiosk.
* If the URL you want to display consist of “https//:” then they wouldn’t work.
